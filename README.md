We believe that a great education is just one big discussion. When students come together and collaborate, whether in small groups or large auditoriums, they can best further information learned in the classroom. Check enables students and administrators to efficiently organize and manage campus events, hassle free.

With the Check mobile application, organizers can register and check-in attendees with their existing ID cards with the NFC technology in mobile devices. Event attendance and other data can be managed securely through the Check web application.
